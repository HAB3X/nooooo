    <h1>Field Report: Investigation into Reports from Morbach</h1>
    <div class="metadata">
      Autumn, 1905<br>
      Morbach, Rhine Province, Kingdom of Prussia<br>
      Filed by: Fr. Alistair M. Connolly<br>
      Diocese of Edinburgh, by order of His Holiness Pope Pius X
    </div>

    <p>Rome has received word of unusual activity near Morbach, a secluded village in the Prussian Rhine Province. Night patrols report seeing a tall, upright figure. Descriptions vary, but all agree: it is neither wholly human nor animal. Quiet speculation now surrounds the possibility of a werewolf.</p>

    <p>Though dismissed by many as drunken folklore, the issue has been elevated to His Holiness. Pope Pius X has ordered an investigation. I have been assigned to the task—whether due to my field experience or the absence of willing others is uncertain.</p>

    <p>The journey from Edinburgh required six days. I departed St. Mary’s Cathedral, boarded a third-class carriage to London, then continued to Dover by rail. A crowded steamer brought me across the Channel in harsh wind and bitter cold.</p>

    <p>In Calais, I took the train to Paris and lodged overnight in a rundown boarding house. The next morning, I traveled eastward through Metz and into Germany. Koblenz was the final main stop. From there, I boarded a local train bound for Wittlich. No further coaches ran past that point. The stationmaster made the sign of the cross at the mention of Morbach and refused to comment.</p>

    <p>No carriage could be hired. No rider would go that way. I continued on foot.</p>

    <p>Morbach is concealed in the Hunsrück hills—small, withdrawn, home to perhaps a few hundred. The terrain is rugged and the forest dense. Oak and pine overgrow the slopes. Streams cut deep valleys. Mist clings to the land, and fog arrives with each dawn. Even spring carries cold.</p>

    <p>Homes are half-timbered: whitewashed walls crossed by dark beams. Most are barn-houses—families and livestock beneath one roof. At the village center: a modest church, a tavern, schoolhouse, and several shrines. Crucifixes hang on nearly every wall. Wolfsbane is pinned to doorways. Blessed herbs and iron charms are kept close. The roads are little more than muddy trails; the nearest train station lies over twenty kilometers away.</p>

    <p>The village does not rise from the land—it sinks into it. Moss, stone, and forest meet at every edge. The woods feel ancient. There is a presence in them, quiet but pressing.</p>

    <p>The villagers observe Catholic rites, yet also cling to old traditions. Talismans share space with holy medals. Prayers are followed by charms whispered in dialect. None pass the shrines at dusk without a murmur or a sprig of St. John's Wort pinned to their coats.</p>

    <p>I had hoped the reports were rumor. Werewolves are not merely beasts—they are spiritual afflictions. To destroy one without proper understanding risks inheriting the curse. I suspect that is why others declined the mission.</p>

    <p>What has been described is no simple animal. It walks upright but with a stoop. Its limbs are long, its proportions wrong. Its eyes glow in torchlight. Skin, dark and rough, is interrupted by coarse bristles. The snout is elongated. Its teeth are yellow and sharp. It moves between man and beast—sometimes quick and low, sometimes upright and still. Its claws mark trees and tear doors. It does not rest. It feels no pain.</p>

    <blockquote>This is not a creature of nature. It is something possessed.</blockquote>
