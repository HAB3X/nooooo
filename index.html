      Morbach, Rhine Province, Kingdom of Prussia<br>
      Fr. Alistair M. Connolly<br>
      Diocese of Edinburgh
    </div>

    <p>Word has reached Rome of strange events in the forests near Morbach, a remote village in the Prussian Rhine Province. Soldiers on night patrol report sightings of a tall, bipedal figure. Descriptions vary, but all agree: it is neither fully man nor beast. Some now whisper of a werewolf.</p>

    <p>Most dismiss the reports as drunken tales, yet the matter has reached the Holy Father. Pope Pius X has ordered an investigation. I have been assigned the task. Whether due to my past experience or simply lack of volunteers is unclear.</p>

    <p>The journey from Edinburgh to Morbach took six days. I left St. Mary’s Cathedral and rode third-class to London—nine hours on splintered wooden benches. From there, I caught a train to Dover and crossed the Channel on a crowded steamer. The wind was bitter, the deck slick with spray.</p>

    <p>In Calais, I boarded a train to Paris and spent the night in a crumbling boarding house near the station. The next morning, I continued east through Metz and into Germany. Koblenz was the final major stop. From there, I took a local train toward Wittlich. Beyond that, no more coaches ran. When I asked about Morbach, the stationmaster made the sign of the cross and said nothing.</p>

    <p>No carriage could be hired. No horseman would take me. I walked the rest of the way alone.</p>

    <p>Morbach lies tucked in the Hunsrück hills, a small, inward-facing village of perhaps a few hundred souls. The land is rough and heavily wooded. Oak and pine cover the slopes, and the valleys are steep, cut by narrow streams. Mist clings to the air. Fog gathers each morning, and winter sleet comes early. Even spring carries a chill.</p>

    <p>The homes are half-timbered—whitewashed walls framed in dark wood. Most are barn-houses, where animals and families live under one roof, divided only by planks. At the center stands a modest Catholic church with a bell tower, flanked by a tavern, schoolhouse, and roadside shrines to the Virgin and saints. Crucifixes adorn nearly every home. Wolfsbane hangs in doorways. Iron keys and blessed herbs are kept in pockets or tied above stable doors. Travel is slow; the roads are little more than muddy tracks. The nearest train station is over twenty kilometers away.</p>

    <p>The village does not stand apart from the land—it blends into it. Earth-colored stones, moss-covered walls, and the ever-pressing forest give the place a sense of age. Something watchful lingers in the woods.</p>

    <p>Though the villagers observe Catholic rites, they mix them with older customs. Holy medals hang beside carved talismans. Prayers are said, but so are whispered charms passed down through generations. None pass the shrines at dusk without a muttered Ave or a sprig of St. John’s Wort pinned to their coat.</p>

    <p>All through my journey, I hoped the reports were mere rumor. Confronting a true werewolf is no small thing. The affliction is not merely physical—it is spiritual. Misunderstanding it can pass the curse to the one who tries to destroy it. Perhaps that is why others refused the mission.</p>

    <p>What the soldiers describe is not just a beast. It walks upright but stoops. Its limbs are long and wrong. Its eyes glow red in torchlight. The skin is dark and coarse, with patches of bristled fur. It has an elongated snout, yellowed teeth, and moves—sometimes like a man, sometimes like an animal—fast, low, and silent. Its claws scar trees and tear through doors. It is said to be tireless. It hunts without sound or rest. It feels no pain.</p>
