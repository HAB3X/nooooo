      Autumn, 1905<br>
      Village of Morbach, Rhine Province, Kingdom of Prussia<br>
      Fr. Alistair M. Connolly, Diocese of Edinburgh
    </div>

    <p>This morning I arrived in Morbach after a long and solitary journey, undertaken at the direction of the Holy See. Strange events have been reported in the forests surrounding this isolated village, accounts so unusual and so disquieting that they have reached as far as Rome. His Holiness, upon reviewing testimony from military witnesses, ordered an inquiry. I was chosen to conduct it.</p>

    <p>Though I am always prepared to serve where the Church requires, I confess I was not expecting a matter such as this. My past assignments were of the familiar kind, possessions, sacrilege entwined with superstition, misused relics. Once, I was sent to the Hebrides, where a local cult had revived ancient rites under the guise of Marian devotion. But lycanthropy? Of that, I have encountered no doctrine. Only scattered fragments of folklore. Stories passed in whispers through trembling lips.</p>

    <p>Still, I accepted without hesitation. One does not turn away when called.</p>

    <p>The journey from Edinburgh took the better part of a week. I departed St. Mary’s before sunrise aboard a third-class train to London, the compartment thick with coal soot and the wet coughs of laborers. From there I made my way to Dover, crossed the Channel under low skies, and traveled eastward by rail through Calais and Paris. In Metz, I boarded a local train that crept through the wooded hills, stopping often for debris on the tracks or disused stations. By the time I reached Koblenz, it was clear the rails ahead had not seen regular service in some time.</p>

    <p>At Wittlich, I inquired about the road to Morbach. The stationmaster offered no reply. A nearby porter, overhearing, muttered something in the local dialect and crossed himself before hurrying away. I found no cart, no driver, no one willing to go farther.</p>

    <p>So I walked.</p>

    <p>The road was unpaved, littered with sodden leaves and choked in mud. I arrived at dusk, my boots soaked through, my coat heavy with mist. The village is nestled between steep forested hills, almost hidden beneath the canopy pressing in from every side. Fog hangs low to the ground, curling up from hollows like smoke from a censer. It is a small place, perhaps two dozen homes, timber-framed and whitewashed, the plaster peeling at the corners. The slate roofs are patched with tin and overgrown with moss.</p>

    <p>The people are cautious. They watch from behind shutters. A few nod politely, but none speak. Many of the houses shelter livestock beneath their roofs, goats and cattle sharing quarters with their keepers. The air carries the sharp scent of peat and dung, mingled with the damp sourness of wet wool. There is no laughter here, no music, only the sound of crows and the distant groan of the forest.</p>

    <p>At the village center stands a modest chapel, its square bell tower blackened by rain and time. Lichen coats the foundation stones. A small graveyard encircles it, bounded by rusted iron rails driven deep into the earth. Nearby I noted a shuttered schoolhouse, a tavern, and three roadside shrines. One to Our Lady. One to Saint Hubert. And one so worn with age that I could not determine to whom it was raised. I found myself strangely unsettled by that final figure, as though even its neglect held a kind of reverence I could not understand.</p>

    <p>As I made my way through the lanes, I began to notice signs. Crucifixes hung above doors, but so too did dried bundles of herbs, tied with string or ribbon. Children wore charms. Red threads. Knots of twigs. What looked like small iron nails. One girl had Saint John’s Wort sewn into her coat lining. These are not Roman customs.</p>

    <p>They are wards. Folk protections. Superstition, perhaps, but rooted in something older. And not, I think, without cause.</p>

    <p>I found the inn, eventually. Gasthaus Zum Hirschen. A timber-framed building that also serves as the village tavern. Inside, the atmosphere was hushed. Conversation, if it had ever begun, had long since died. The patrons eyed me in silence.</p>

    <p>I approached the woman behind the bar and inquired whether a room might be available for the night. She said nothing, but gestured toward a small wooden sign that read, one Mark per night. I retrieved the Marks I had exchanged earlier at the train station and handed one across the counter. Without ceremony, I was shown the way to the lodgings.</p>

    <p>The staircase was narrow and wooden, groaning beneath each step. The room itself was plain, cold, and sparsely furnished. A single bed stood against the wall, its frame of dark wood or iron, creaking at the slightest touch. The mattress was stuffed with straw. The blanket coarse and scratchy. The linen thin and worn. The pillow was lumpy, filled with feathers or perhaps more straw, damp at one corner, as though it had never fully dried. I sat in silence, staring at the flame of the lone candle, wondering if even it was reluctant to remain alight in this place.</p>

    <p>With only a few hours before dusk, I began to devise myself a plan for the night. I unpacked what I had brought.</p>

    <p>My satchel, worn and weathered from the journey, bore the weight not of worldly goods but of sacred implements and hard-earned precautions. From its folds I drew first my breviary, marked with ribbons at the necessary psalms, and the Rituale Romanum, bound in dark leather. The text bears marginalia in my own hand. Verses to be spoken swiftly. Prayers for strength. Invocations against corruption. Folded within its pages is a letter sealed by the Archdiocese of Edinburgh, authorising my investigation under full ecclesiastical authority.</p>

    <p>Next, I withdrew a small brass vial of holy water, drawn from the font at Saint Mary’s before I departed. Its stopper is bound with wax and twine, not for security but reverence. With it, an aspergillum, should I need to bless ground, threshold, or corpse. I carry also a vial of chrism oil, mixed with ash from last Lent’s palms. Reserved for final unction, or the marking of sacred bounds.</p>

    <p>For protection, I wear a Saint Benedict medal, strung on red wool and knotted thrice, a gift from the nuns at Fort Augustus. It hangs beneath my cassock, close to the skin. In one coat pocket rests a small relic of Saint Hubert, a shard of bone set in tin, whose intercession is sought against rabid beasts and afflictions of the mind.</p>

    <p>Wrapped in cloth at the bottom of my pack is the object I hesitate to touch even now. A dagger, its blade narrow and silver-plated, no longer than my forearm. It was blessed in silence by an old Benedictine who knew better than to ask questions. Along the flat of the blade are etched the words, Libera Nos A Malo. It is not meant for punishment, but release. For that which no longer bears the image of God.</p>

    <p>Finally, I produced two small leather pouches. One containing consecrated salt. The other a mix of Saint John’s Wort, rowan bark, and iron shavings. Superstitions, perhaps, but I have learned not to scorn what keeps men alive in places like this.</p>

    <p>I placed each item upon the desk with care, lighting a candle beside them. The flame danced nervously, though no wind disturbed it. The shadows it cast seemed to shift more than they should, as if stirred by something unseen. In that flickering light, I could no longer keep my thoughts from turning to the true nature of my mission.</p>

    <p>I had hoped, during my journey, that the stories were exaggerated. But a werewolf, if such a thing can be said to exist, is not simply an animal. The Church teaches that monstrosity is not found in form, but in the corruption of the soul. Such a creature would be as much a spiritual affliction as a physical one, a curse visited upon the body, born of some deep iniquity. Whether it is self-inflicted or imposed by another, it cannot be regarded as illness alone.</p>

    <p>There are those who believe that to kill such a thing outside ritual or sanction risks transmission, that the curse may pass to the slayer. The idea chills me more than I care to admit. For if it is true, then violence becomes not a cure, but a contagion. A seed planted in the soul.</p>

    <p>The accounts I have gathered so far describe a figure that walks like a man but resembles no man at all. It is tall, its limbs overlong, its spine hunched. The eyes burn red as coals. The skin is dark and coarse, broken in places by thick, bristling hair. The mouth extends into a narrow snout lined with crooked yellow teeth. It moves with unnatural speed, shifting between two legs and four as though its flesh offered no resistance.</p>

    <p>It does not cry out when it hunts. Dogs refuse to track it. Some claim it does not bleed. Others insist it cannot be harmed by blade or bullet. One soldier told me, his voice hoarse with remembered terror, that it stood over his fallen comrade for nearly a full minute, silent, unmoving, before vanishing into the trees.</p>

    
    <blockquote>Even now, as I write, I feel as though I am being watched. The walls here are thin. The forest presses in from every side, and the candle flickers though the windows remain shut. There is something old at work here. Older than the village. Older than the Church. Something that does not speak but waits. And watches. And remembers.</blockquote>
