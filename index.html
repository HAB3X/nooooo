      Autumn, 1905<br>
      Village of Morbach, Rhine Province, Kingdom of Prussia<br>
      Fr. Alistair M. Connolly, Diocese of Edinburgh
    </div>

    <p>This morning I arrived in Morbach after a long and solitary journey, undertaken at the direction of the Holy See. Strange events have been reported in the forests surrounding this isolated village—accounts so unusual, so disquieting, that they have reached as far as Rome. His Holiness, upon reviewing testimony from military witnesses, ordered an inquiry. I was chosen to conduct it.</p>

    <p>Though I am always prepared to serve where the Church requires, I confess I was not expecting a matter such as this. My past assignments were of the familiar kind—possessions, sacrilege entwined with superstition, misused relics. Once, I was sent to the Hebrides, where a local cult had revived ancient rites under the guise of Marian devotion. But lycanthropy? Of that, I’ve encountered no doctrine. Only scattered fragments of folklore.</p>

    <p>Still, I accepted without hesitation. One does not turn away when called.</p>

    <p>The journey from Edinburgh took the better part of a week. I departed St. Mary’s before sunrise aboard a third-class train to London, the compartment thick with coal soot and the wet coughs of laborers. From there I made my way to Dover, crossed the Channel under low skies, and traveled eastward by rail through Calais and Paris. In Metz, I boarded a local train that crept through the wooded hills, stopping often for debris on the tracks or disused stations. By the time I reached Koblenz, it was clear the rails ahead had not seen regular service in some time.</p>

    <p>At Wittlich, I inquired about the road to Morbach. The stationmaster offered no reply. A nearby porter, overhearing, muttered something in the local dialect and crossed himself before hurrying away. I found no cart, no driver—no one willing to go farther.</p>

    <p>So I walked.</p>

    <p>The road was unpaved, littered with sodden leaves and choked in mud. I arrived at dusk, my boots soaked through, my coat heavy with mist. The village is nestled between steep forested hills, almost hidden beneath the canopy pressing in from every side. Fog hangs low to the ground, curling up from hollows like smoke from a censer. It is a small place—perhaps two dozen homes, timber-framed and whitewashed, the plaster peeling at the corners. The slate roofs are patched with tin and overgrown with moss.</p>

    <p>The people are cautious. They watch from behind shutters. A few nod politely, but none speak. Many of the houses shelter livestock beneath their roofs—goats and cattle sharing quarters with their keepers. The air carries the sharp scent of peat and dung, mingled with the damp sourness of wet wool.</p>

    <p>At the village center stands a modest chapel, its square bell tower blackened by rain and time. Lichen coats the foundation stones. A small graveyard encircles it, bounded by rusted iron rails driven deep into the earth. Nearby I noted a shuttered schoolhouse, a tavern, and three roadside shrines—one to Our Lady, one to St. Hubert, and one so weathered I could not make out to whom it was raised.</p>

    <p>As I made my way through the lanes, I began to notice signs. Crucifixes hung above doors, but so too did dried bundles of herbs, tied with string or ribbon. Children wore charms: red threads, knots of twigs, what looked like small iron nails. One girl had St. John’s Wort sewn into her coat lining. These are not Roman customs.</p>

    <p>They are wards. Folk protections—superstition, yes, but rooted in something older. And not, I think, without cause.</p>

    <p>I had hoped, during my journey, that the stories were exaggerated. But a werewolf—if such a thing can be said to exist—is not simply an animal. The Church teaches that monstrosity is not found in form, but in the corruption of the soul. Such a creature would be as much a spiritual affliction as a physical one: a curse visited upon the body, born of some deep iniquity. Whether it is self-inflicted or imposed by another, it cannot be regarded as illness alone.</p>

    <p>There are those who believe that to kill such a thing outside ritual or sanction risks transmission—that the curse may pass to the slayer.</p>

    <p>The thought gives me pause.</p>

    <p>The accounts I’ve gathered so far describe a figure that walks like a man but resembles no man at all. It is tall, its limbs overlong, its spine hunched. The eyes burn red as coals. The skin is dark and coarse, broken in places by thick, bristling hair. The mouth extends into a narrow snout lined with crooked yellow teeth. It moves with unnatural speed, shifting between two legs and four as though its flesh offered no resistance.</p>

    <p>It does not cry out when it hunts. Dogs refuse to track it. Some claim it does not bleed. Others insist it cannot be harmed by blade or bullet. One soldier told me, his voice hoarse with remembered terror, that it stood over his fallen comrade for nearly a full minute—silent, unmoving—before vanishing into the trees.</p>

    <blockquote>Something walks in these woods. And I do not believe it is merely a beast. It is something possessed.</blockquote>
