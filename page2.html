      Night of 22 October, 1905<br>
      Morbach

    <p>I waited until the village was asleep.</p>

    <p>The candlelight dimmed in the last windows shortly after ten. By half-past, only the tavern offered a faint, flickering glow behind its shutters. It reminded me of a dying ember, and I found myself staring at it longer than I should have, as if expecting it to vanish too. I gathered what I would need: my breviary, the relic of Saint Hubert, the silver-plated dagger, salt in one pouch, and iron filings in the other. I left my cloak hanging behind the door. It was heavy with damp and would only slow me. The chill outside was biting, but the wind had stilled completely. There was something unsettling in that stillness, as though the very air held its breath. A thin frost slicked the leaves beneath my boots and turned the earth to brittle glass.</p>

    <p>I made no announcement of my intent. The villagers do not speak openly of what moves through their woods, but their silence is a kind of liturgy. A warning passed from one generation to the next without the need for words. I passed the chapel, pausing only to nod once to the rusted gate that rings the dead, and turned toward the dark trees that rise just beyond the last row of houses.</p>

    <p>There is a narrow trail beyond the village, one used by hunters and children, though now it seems forsaken by both. It winds beneath the boughs in uneasy loops, hemmed with nettles and thorns. The forest in October is never silent. Owls, foxes, the shifting of branches—these things are constant. But tonight, the hush was total. It pressed against my ears and pulsed in my skull. Not absence of sound, but the presence of something deeper. Something listening.</p>

    <p>For nearly an hour I walked, moving slowly, stopping often. I heard only the crunch of frost beneath my feet and the dull sound of my own breath. Eventually, the path widened. I came upon a clearing. Ten paces across, no more. The soil had been turned over, blackened and clawed, as though something immense had circled there again and again. The trees that bordered it bore deep gouges—long, vertical tears in the bark. Too high for deer. Too clean for boar.</p>

    <p>At the center lay the carcass of a goat. Its body was twisted, throat torn wide, legs bent backwards at grotesque angles. It had not been eaten. Death was not the point. Around it lay a circle of bones, small and carefully placed. Chicken. Rabbit. Squirrel. The offering of a purpose I did not yet understand.</p>

    <p>I made the sign of the cross. My hand trembled as I did it. I drew a breath and began the Exorcismus in Satanam et Angelos Apostaticos. The Latin tasted sour in my mouth. My voice was steady, but each word seemed to fall into the stillness without echo. The final verse had barely left my lips when I felt it.</p>

    <p>A presence.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I was not the watcher. I was being watched.</p>

    <p>I turned slowly.</p>

    <p>It stood between the trees. Fifteen paces distant. Its form partially obscured by the shadows, but its eyes glowed. Not the reflection of moonlight, but a fire of their own. Ember red. Slow and unblinking. Its chest rose and fell, but otherwise it did not move. The beast was tall, a head taller than any man, its shoulders hunched like it carried centuries upon its back. The fur was mottled and unclean, dark with filth. Its snout stretched forward too far, mouth parted just enough to show a line of yellow, crooked teeth. It did not growl. It did not charge. It watched.</p>

    <p>I drew the dagger. The silver caught a trace of moonlight that managed to pierce the canopy. I raised it, murmuring a half-formed invocation.</p>

    <p>It vanished.</p>

    <p>Not fled. Not bolted. Simply gone. As if the dark had welcomed it home.</p>

    <p>Then I heard the leaves behind me shift.</p>

    <p>I turned too slowly.</p>

    <p>It struck me from the side, shoulder first, with force that defied reason. I was lifted from the ground and thrown against a root. My ribs cracked, or so it felt. My breath left me in a single, sickening rush. Still I brought the blade up. I caught its arm as it swiped, scoring the flesh. It let out no sound. Its claws tore through cassock and skin alike. I shouted a prayer—I do not know which, only that it came from the gut—and drove the dagger upward.</p>

    <p>The blade found flesh.</p>

    <p>The creature reeled back. Not in pain, but fury. The howl it gave was not a beast’s howl. It was something else. Something older. It was not wounded. It was offended. Violated. As though I had broken some ancient rite.</p>

    <p>Then it came again.</p>

    <p>Its jaws clamped down on my shoulder. Not a clean bite, but a grinding crush of bone and sinew. I screamed. Or thought I did. I could not hear it. I stabbed again, blindly, and this time the blade struck deep.</p>

    <p>Something broke.</p>

    <p>It released me.</p>

    <p>Two long strides and it vanished once more, into the dark.</p>

    <p>I lay on my back, gasping. Blood poured from my side, warm even in the cold air. My hand would not unclench the dagger. I staggered to my feet. I held the blade high, searching for any sign of the thing, but there was none. The frost was unbroken. No prints. No blood.</p>

    <p>Even its presence had vanished.</p>

    <p>I stood there for what felt like hours. The pain in my shoulder throbbed with a heat that bordered on fever. I pressed salt into the wound, biting down hard against the agony, and tore a strip of my undershirt to bind it. The fabric soaked through almost instantly.</p>

    <p>Only when I heard the distant call of a wolf—long, rising, mournful—did I turn back toward the village. Not near. But not far enough.</p>

    <p>I reached Morbach before dawn. The windows were dark. No lamps burned. No dogs barked. Even the crows had gone quiet.</p>

    <p>And still I felt it.</p>

    <p>It had left the woods behind, but it had not retreated. It had changed. Shifted. Withdrawn just beyond the edges of seeing. But it was still watching. Still listening.</p>

    <p>I fear the battle was not won. I fear it has only just begun.</p>
